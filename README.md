# EEE3453
Just a backup folder for my EEE3453 course code. You can just ignore this repository.

### Some of the file in this repository gonna need the CODE library from [releases](https://github.com/wingyeung0317/EEE3453/releases).

### Lots of my files are based on PlatformIO (because I can easily connect it to wokwi via VSCode. Also, PlatformIO upload much faster then Arduino IDE). PlatformIO still use Arduino as framework. So, most of the times, you can easily transform /src/main.cpp to foo.ino by just changing the file extension name.
